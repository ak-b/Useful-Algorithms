The 'Input.txt' and 'Output.txt' are, surprise surprise, the input and output files respectively. 

The 'Quicksort_not_in_place.py' file contains the implementation with the 1st element as pivot and is not in-place.

The 'Quicksort_in_place.py' file contains the implementation with the 1st element as pivot and is in-place.

The 'Quicksort_last_ele_pivot.py' file contains the implementation with the last element as pivot and is in-place.

The 'Quicksort_medianOf3_pivot.py' file contains the implementation with the median of the 
1st,last and middle elements as pivot and is in-place.

Possible Sources of Improvement:

a)Use of optimizer packages which enables efficient use of tail recursion in python.

b) Implementing the same algorithms in another language where tail recursion is highly optimized by default, like Java.

c) An iterative, non-recursive implementation of the same algorithms
