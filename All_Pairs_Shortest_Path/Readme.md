All Pairs Shortest Path
======================

This problem can be solved by several ways - listed here are python implementations of Bellman-Ford algorithm run n times, Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Johnsons Algorithm. All the source files print the minimum distance among all the shortest path distances for every pair of vertices.

##Input Format

In all the input files, the 1st line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. The other lines describe an edge - listing the 2 connected vertices and the edge weight/cost. For example, the line:

4 1 -2

indicates that there is an edge from source vertex 4 to destination vertex 1 with cost -2.
