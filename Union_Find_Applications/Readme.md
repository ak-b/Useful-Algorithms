Union-Find Applications
========

Python implementations of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and Single-Link Clustering algorithm 
using multiple variants of the Union-Find data structure and also without using the Union-Find.
Please note that Union-Find is also known as Disjoint-set data structure.

##Input Format

In all the input text files,for each edge, there is a line in the text file listing the 2 connected vertices and the edge weight. For example, the line:

1 2 6807

indicates that vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 with an edge of cost 6807.
The only exception is the 1st line which either lists the number of vertices and number of edges or 
only the number of vertices.


The code files are described below:

##Note:


where,

m = #edges

n = #vertices
