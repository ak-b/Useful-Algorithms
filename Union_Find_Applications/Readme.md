Union-Find Applications
========

Python implementations of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and Single-Link Clustering algorithm 
using multiple variants of the Union-Find data structure and also without using the Union-Find.
Union-Find is also known as Disjoint-set data structure. 
The Kruskal implementations print the sum of edge-costs of the Minimum Spanning Tree. The Single-Link Clustering 
implementations print maximum-spacing when the number of clusters is 4.

##Input Format

In all the input text files,for each edge, there is a line in the text file listing the 2 connected vertices and the edge weight. For example, the line:

1 2 6807

indicates that vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 with an edge of cost 6807.
The only exception is the 1st line which either lists the number of vertices and number of edges or 
only the number of vertices.
