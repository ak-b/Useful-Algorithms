Well-Known-Algorithms
=====================

Implementation of well known algorithms, mainly graphs and sorting,  in python

These algorithms are:

##a) Djikstra - 
The famous Djikstra's algorithm.

##b) Graph Search - 
Depth-first-search and breadth-first-search.

##c) Number Of Inversions - 
Counting the number of inversions in an array. 

##d) Quick Sort - 
Numerous variants of Quicksort.

##e)Randomized Contraction Algorithm - 
The randomized contraction algorithm to compute number of Minimum cuts in a graph.

The individual folders also have Readme files which contain details about these implementations.
