Useful-Algorithms
=====================

Implementation of well known algorithms, mainly graphs and sorting,  in python

These algorithms are listed below in alphabetical order:

## Djikstra - 
It is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs.

## Graph Search - 
Depth-first-search and breadth-first-search.

## Number Of Inversions - 
Counting the number of inversions in an array. 

## Prim's Algorithm - 
It is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph.

## Quick Sort - 
Numerous variants of Quicksort.

## Randomized Contraction Algorithm - 
The randomized contraction algorithm to compute number of Minimum cuts in a graph.

## Applications of Union-Find -
Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and Single-Link Clustering algorithm are implemented with multiple variants of the Union-Find data structure and also without using the Union-Find.

In all cases, the times taken by the algorithms to run are reported. The individual folders also have Readme files which contain details about these implementations.
